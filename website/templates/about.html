        Well thought out ideas are upvoted regardless of opinion. Healthy disagreement is encouraged - the best way to learn is to be challenged.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight">
        It is exciting when someone disagrees with you:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>If you find out you're wrong, you learn something new.</li>
        <li>If a good argument for the other side is given and you still disagree, you learn more about your own position and are prepared to defend it in the future.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="highlight">
        Remember:
    </p>

    <p>Ideas are not owned; you want the best ones to serve you.</p>
    <p>Ideas are treated as machines, and we aim for the best ones.</p>
    <p>Upvote topics that have good points and make you think, regardless of your personal opinions.</p>
