<h1>Hey, I'm Kyle ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>I'm a Security Engineer, researcher, and student just trying to make cool stuff and figure it out as I go.</p>

<h2>ðŸ’» Stuff Iâ€™ve Worked On:</h2>

- <b>LLM Semantic Research</b>  
  Researching how meaning shifts in vector space across BERT/GPT-2 layers. Mostly Python, with heavy use of sklearn and PCA.

- <b>Security Engineering @ Menlo Security</b>  
  Automation tools, internal OS maintenance, Splunk config, and compliance engineering (FedRAMP, SOC-2, etc).

- <b>TA for Python Programming at OSU</b>  
  Lead sessions, debug studentsâ€™ code, and help make Python less scary.

- <b>Democratized Algorithmic Trading</b>  
  Making algo trading more accessible for everyday people. Work in progress.
  Used technologies such as python backtesting library, Trello, AWS.
  Example of backtesting output using buy and hold vs a trading algorithm:
